      <p>
          Since its opening on Christmas Eve 1959, Caravelle Saigon has gained renown for being at the heart of everything important in this great city. Located in the city centre district 1, our luxury hotel is a short walk to iconic landmarks and locations, such as the Saigon Municipal Theatre, also known as the Opera House, Notre Dame Cathedral, historic Dong Khoi Street, modern Nguyen Hue Walking Street, and the legendary Ben Thanh Market. Within its walls, our historical, vintage hotel has been at the centre of significant historic and cultural events as well, beginning with its original design hailed at the time as one of the tallest and most modern buildings of its kind in Vietnam.
