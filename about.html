        <p>Excellent hotel. Great service
The room was very spacious, clean, and had the amenities we needed. Breakfast was delicious and with many choices; it was a very wide buffet spread. The people in the reception were very helpful, not just on checkin and checkout, but also in giving directions to spots. The location is great- very near Central Train Station. I would recommend to friends, and will definitely stay again if Im back in Helsinki"</p>

          <p>"Great central location
I stayed at Hotel Arthur for a night, really enjoyed its location in the city centre where everything is within walking distance. The staff was very helpful, breakfast really delicious, and the room nice. I appreciated the luggage room option as well."</p>
